Intermodal Cargo System done by Algochefs

Our solution utilize a fine-tuned GPT-AI model to optimally cluster and plan Cargos shipments, prioritising Efficiency and Sustainability.

Our model is generated through iterative prompt training to refine how cargos are clustered.

Some of the Final model Considerations:  
1) Cluster by geographical proximity : reduce travel distance and optimize routes
2) Deadline : Ensure customer's satisfaction
3) Priority for ships instead of planes : More efficient and significant carbon saving
4) Balancing Cluster Size : Reduce trips and optimise capacity use
